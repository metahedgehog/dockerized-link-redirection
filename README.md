### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Docker installed on your system.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Running the Application
Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/metahedgehog/link-redirection-docker.git
```

Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd link-redirection-docker
```

Build the docker container

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Run container in background

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The application will start and be accessible at http://localhost:6100/. You can change the port in the docker-compose.yml file if needed.

___
### Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can access it through a web browser or make HTTP requests to it. Here are the available routes:

- '/': Accessing this route will redirect you to the target link specified in the environment variable TARGET_LINK. The redirection count will be saved locally, and the count will be incremented with each redirection.

- '/counter': Accessing this route will return the current redirection count.

Example usage with curl:

```bash
# Redirect to the target link
curl http://localhost:6100/

# Get the current redirection count
curl http://localhost:6100/counter
```

___
### Configuration

You can configure the application by modifying the environment variables in the .env file. The following variables are available:

- __TARGET_LINK__: The URL to which incoming connections will be redirected.
